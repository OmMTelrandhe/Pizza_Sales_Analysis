ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores pizza sales data to uncover key business insights. Using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, the goal was to transform raw data into actionable information that helps a pizza company understand customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

SQL Server â€“ for querying and analysis

Power BI â€“ for building interactive dashboards

Excel â€“ for initial data handling and formatting

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Measure important business KPIs such as Total Revenue, Orders, and Average Order Value

Analyze customer preferences across pizza categories and sizes

Identify top-selling and underperforming pizzas

Study daily and monthly order patterns to optimize operations

ðŸ“Š Key Insights

Sales peak during weekends and specific months (e.g., July & May).

Large-sized pizzas contributed the highest share of revenue.

The Classic category was the top performer, while certain pizzas like Brie Carre underperformed.

Top sellers (e.g., Thai Chicken Pizza, Classic Deluxe) generated the majority of revenue, while a few items had very low demand.
